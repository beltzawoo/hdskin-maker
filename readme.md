# HDSkin-maker

## What is this?
This tool allows you to take a regular Minecraft skin, and convert it to an hd skin by replacing each of its pixels by a Minecraft block!

## How do I use it?
Clone the repo, and install the requirements (Pillow).
Then, copy the "blocks" folder of a resource pack to the same folder as the main.py file.
Finally, launch main.py, insert your skin filename, change the colors.json to your liking, and launch main.py again, but with phase 2!
